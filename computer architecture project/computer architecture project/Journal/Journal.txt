- Worked on the integration of the Immgen and the new alu into the preexisting code
- debugged some present issues in the old code 
- cleaned the branching mechanism by creating the branchig unit
- created the first set of the I instruction 
- created the second set of the I instructions (the shifts)
- created the LUI instruction 
- tried to create the AUIPC instruction but failed 
- cleaned the code (as much as i could) 
- created the report and the architecture 
- organized the submission file


MS 2 ///////////rq: the dates are when teh verison of that code was done not when it was started , i worked on mutiple threads simultanesly

1- implemented the forwarding unit and the hazard detection unit on pipelined inmpelimentation (2 memories) 
2- fixed issues with the pipeline developed in the lab
3-2024/04/21 4:22am integrated the full alu and its control unit to accomodate for all instructions tested only on add sub or
4- 2024/04/21 5:25am : integrated the branch unit
	needs more testing
	but it works fine with the BEQ
	also clened the defines of hazard unit and fowarding unit
5-2024/04/22 12:18am: in this version we are trying to integrate the control unit to accomodate for all the flags needed for the other instructions
cleaned the top module 
	**what next** 
	fix the fix the branching to accomodate for the jump
	update architecture and wiring for to integrate all the new conditions
6-2024/04/22 1:28am: creating the new links between the the componenets to make the operations operational
	fixed the branching module and its consequence
	**to do next**
	fix the input to the reg data for auipc and jal/jalr
7- 2024/04/23 12:11am fixed the input to the reg data for auipc and jal/jalr
	--> done 
	**to do next**
	make the one memory + test
8- 2024/04/23 1:17pm all inst + 1 mem
	how? --> make a sclk and have the components alternate btw clocks with instructions 	read on the posedge and the data on the negedge
	- added slow clock 
	- changed all the clocks to sclk or ~sclk(regs)
9-2024/04/23 3:30pm tryign to integrate the decompression unit fixed the branching signals getting out of the ALU
10- 2024/04/23 8:19pm Here we added other files like defines and branch unit so far everything works except for the store
